## 🚀 **Upload Instructions**

### **Step 1: Upload Files**
1. Zip the entire `php-version` folder
2. In cPanel File Manager, go to `public_html`
3. Upload and extract the zip file
4. **IMPORTANT**: Extract contents directly to `public_html`, not into a subfolder

### **Step 2: Import Database**
1. Open phpMyAdmin in cPanel
2. Select your `medsgo_NPDB` database
3. Click "Import" tab
4. Upload `database/schema.sql`
5. Click "Go" to import

### **Step 3: Set Permissions**
In File Manager, set these permissions:
- `uploads/` folder: **755**
- `.htaccess` file: **644**
- All `.php` files: **644**

### **Step 4: Test Your Site**
Visit these URLs after upload:

**Homepage:**
- `https://yourdomain.com/` → Should show your React app
- `https://yourdomain.com/?php=1` → Should show PHP fallback

**Admin Panel:**
- `https://yourdomain.com/admin/`
- Login: `admin@medsgo.com` / `admin123`
- **Change password immediately!**

**API Test:**
- `https://yourdomain.com/api/products.php` → Should return JSON

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After upload, you'll have:
- **Same interface** you see in Replit
- **Same functionality** (cart, orders, admin panel)
- **Same data** (products, categories, user system)
- **Better performance** (optimized for production)
- **SEO friendly** (search engines get PHP version)

## 🔧 **Post-Upload Configuration**

### **1. Change Admin Credentials**
In phpMyAdmin, run:
```sql
UPDATE admin_users 
SET email = 'youremail@yourdomain.com', 
    password_hash = '$2y$10$YOUR_NEW_HASH_HERE'
WHERE id = 1;
```

### **2. Configure Email (Optional)**
Edit `config/email.php` with your hosting SMTP settings.

### **3. Enable SSL**
In cPanel, enable SSL certificate for HTTPS.

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Homepage loads React interface
- ✅ Products display with images
- ✅ Cart functions work (add/remove items)
- ✅ User registration works

- ✅ Orders can be placed and approved

## 🎉 **You're Ready to Go Live!**

**Everything is configured and ready - just upload and test!**
